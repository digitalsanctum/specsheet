[Specsheet](https://specsheet.software/) is the software testing toolkit.

Specsheet is a command-line utility that abstracts over the general testing pattern: running commands, examining their output, and collecting the results.

It can be used to test software, your computing environment, your cloud servers, and other things.

Specsheet is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
You will need rustc version 1.42.0 or higher.
The recommended way to install Rust for development is from the [official download page](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), using rustup.

Once Rust is installed, you can compile Specsheet with Cargo:

    $ cargo build
    $ cargo test

- The [just](https://github.com/casey/just) command runner can be used to run some helpful development commands, in a manner similar to `make`.
Run `just --tasks` to get an overview of what’s available.

- If you are compiling a copy for yourself, be sure to run `cargo build --release` or `just build-release` to benefit from release-mode optimisations.
Copy the resulting binary, which will be in the `target/release` directory, into a folder in your `$PATH`.
`/usr/local/bin` is usually a good choice.

- To compile and install the manual pages, you will need [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/).
The `just man` command will compile the Markdown into manual pages, which it will place in the `target/man` directory.
To use them, copy them into a directory that `man` will read.
`/usr/local/share/man` is usually a good choice.
